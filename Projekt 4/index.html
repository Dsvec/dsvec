<p>Microcar / kei car:2018 Aixam Crossline

Microcars and their Japanese equivalent kei cars are the smallest category of automobile.
Microcars straddle the boundary between car and motorbike, and are often covered by separate regulations to normal cars, resulting in relaxed requirements for registration and licensing. Engine size is often 700 cc (43 cu in) or less, and microcars have three or four wheels.

Microcars are most popular in Europe, where they originated following World War II. The predecessors to micro cars are voiturettes and cycle cars. Kei cars have been used in Japan since 1949.

Examples of microcars and kei cars:

Honda Life
Smart ForTwo
Tata Nano
A-segment / City car / Minicompact</p>

Main article: A-segment
The smallest category of vehicles that are registered as normal cars is called A-segment in Europe, or "city car" in Europe and the United States. The United States Environmental Protection Agency defines this category as "minicompact", however this term is not widely used.

The equivalents of A-segment cars have been produced since the early 1920s, however the category increased in popularity in the late 1950s when the original Fiat 500 and BMC Mini were released.

Examples of A-segment / city cars / minicompact cars:

Fiat 500
Hyundai i10
Toyota Aygo
B-segment / Supermini / Subcompact</p>

Main articles: B-segment, Supermini, and Subcompact car
The next larger category small cars is called B-segment Europe, supermini in the United Kingdom and subcompact in the United States.

The size of a subcompact car is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as having a combined interior and cargo volume of between 85 99 cubic feet (2,410 2,800 L).Since the EPA's smaller minicompact category is not as commonly used by the general public, A segment cars are sometimes called subcompacts in the United States. In Europe and Great Britain, the B segment and supermini categories do not any formal definitions based on size.

Early supermini cars in Great Britain include the 1977 Ford Fiesta and Vauxhall Chevette.

In the United States, the first locally-built subcompact cars were the 1970 AMC Gremlin, Chevrolet Vega, and Ford Pinto.

Examples of B-segment / supermini / subcompact cars:

Chevrolet Aveo (Chevrolet Sonic)
Hyundai Accent
Volkswagen Polo
C-segment / Small family / Compact</p>

The size of a compact car is defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as having a combined interior and cargo volume of 100 109 cu ft (2.8 3.1 m3).[5]

Examples of C-segment / compact / small family cars:
